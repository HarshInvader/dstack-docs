# Dashboards

### What is a Dashboard?

Once you've pushed your data to dstack.ai using the`dstack` packages for Python and R, you can combine your datasets and visualizations into interactive dashboards â€“ with just a few clicks.

Dashboards are a great way to build great-looking interactive reports. In order to build a dashboard, you only need to push your visualizations via Python or R API and then combine them into one dashboard with a few clicks.

Here's an example of a simple dashboard: [https://dstack.ai/cheptsov/d/505d2087-9adc-49e3-88de-6b46079c394f](https://dstack.ai/cheptsov/d/505d2087-9adc-49e3-88de-6b46079c394f)
{% endhint %}

If a _Stack_ displays each moment a single visualization that corresponds to the selected parameters, a _Dashboard_ displays multiple visualizations at once â€“ also based on selected parameters.

### Here's how to create a Dashboard:

1. Create _Stacks_ by [pushing](pushing-visualizations.md) your visualizations via the Python or R API. Those can be either _Static stacks_ or _Interactive stacks_. 
2. Click _Dashboards_ in the sidebar of [dstack.ai](https://dstack.ai) and then click _New dashboard_.
3. You'll see a new empty _Dashboard_. Now, go ahead, click _Add Stack_, and select the _Stacks_ that you'd like to put to your _Dashboard_. You can add as many _Stacks_ as you'd like.
4. Once you've selected the _Stacks_, click _Add selected stacks_. You'll see the selected _Stacks_ added to the current _Dashboard_.
5. Now you can change the title of the _Dashboard_ or any of the _Stacks_ by mouse-clicking their titles.
6. Finally, you can switch the access level for this _Dashboard_ between _Public_ and _Private_, and share it with specific users by entering their usernames or emails. In order to do that, click _Share._

The user, with whom you've shared the dashboard, will be able to open the dashboard and see it updating based on the parameters selected. Note, the parameters are shown only in case the added stacks have parameters.

**That is it. Go ahead, and build your interactive dashboards right away! ðŸš€**
