# Jobs for Automation

dstack.ai allows you to execute simple Python and R jobs right on dstack.ai â€“ either on demand or automatically at a regular schedule. These jobs can run use basic scientific packages, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, and `dstack`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, etc.

The jobs are ideal for processing data regularly and [publishing the results](pushing-visualizations.md) in the form of stacks, e.g. data [visualizations](pushing-visualizations.md#pushing-static-visualizations-or-datasets) or [datasets](../tutorials/datasets.md).

In addition to running jobs at a fixed schedule, jobs can be also used as an alternative to Jupyter notebooks when you need to quickly run a piece of code to push data to dstack.ai.
