# Collaboration

Sharing results and exchanging feedback increases the efficiency of the data science process. Few important problems can be solved solely without any input from others. Even if the work can be done by one person, it's important to share the results with others to make real impact.

dstack.ai helps data scientists collaborate more effectively by giving them convenient tools to share datasets and visualizations and exchange feedback.

Once the data is pushed to dstack.ai, it can be shared either with anyone or with selected users only.

{% hint style="info" %}
If needed, you can invite a collaborator into your visualization, dataset or dashboard by an email.
{% endhint %}

When you have access to a dataset, a visualization, or a dashboard, you can see its revisions, and exchange comments.

_Let your data scientists build on the results of each other, and make their results work for the entire company! 📈🚀👩🏽‍🔬_
